# Swift5 API client for XaynFrontOfficeSdk

# Front Office
The system identifies a user with only an id.
There are two main endpoints: one that allows registering an interaction between a user and a document (a user clicked or liked a document), and one to retrieve a personalized set of documents for the user. The system needs a few user interactions with documents before it can generate a personalized list.

# Auth
To authenticate with the API, a token will be provided.
